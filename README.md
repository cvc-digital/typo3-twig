This TYPO3 extensions allows you to use the fabulous Twig template engine within your TYPO3 project.

You can use Twig templates in your Extbase controllers or in your TypoScript.

## Installation

This extension only works when installed in composer mode. If you are not familiar using composer together with TYPO3
yetyou can find a [how to on the TYPO3 website](https://composer.typo3.org/).

Install the extension with the following command:

```bash
composer require cvc/typo3-twig
```

## Getting started

Rendering of Twig templates works nearly exactly the same way as rendering Fluid templates.

In contrast to Fluid there are no "layouts" nor "partials" in Twig. Everything is "just" a template. Therefore there
are some features missing that you are probably used by Fluid.

### Render templates in TypoScript

To render a Twig template you can use the `TWIGTEMPLATE` content object.

```typo3_typoscript
page.10 = TWIGTEMPLATE
page.10 {
    templateName = example.html.twig
    variables {
        foo = TEXT
        foo.value = Bar!
    }
    templateRootPaths {
        10 = EXT:twig/Resources/Private/TwigTemplates
    }
}
```

## Documentation

The full documentation is available here: [cvc_twig Documentation](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/cvc_twig/).

## Alternatives

This extension is not the first extension that supports rendering Twig templates. We decided to create our own
extension, because other extensions were either not maintained anymore, they carried to much overhead or they were not
developed close to the Fluid implementation.
